## Getting started

This is how we write a basic pattern in strudel

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh")`} dirt />

you play the sound by pressing the play button or hitting ctrl and enter

you can stop the sound by hitting ctrl + .

what happens if we put more sounds in the pattern?
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd")`} dirt />

even more?
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd hh sn oh bd")`} dirt />

(etc etc)

this is because strudel has a consistent 'cycle' running in the background
any sounds in the pattern will run within that cycle
and strudel will try to space them evenly in time
unless we give explicit instructions for them not to
we'll learn how to do that later

this means that the pulse of the pattern is dictated by the number of elements

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh bd sn")`} dirt />

//vs

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh bd hh cp")`} dirt />

later on when we learn how to play multiple patterns at once
this gives us some fun opportunities to play with rhythm

try some other sounds
insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space numbers

the green writing inside the speech marks has its own set of rules
we call this the 'mininotation' and it's the core of how strudel generates patterns

we can speed things up with *

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*4")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*32")`} dirt />

or slow them down with /

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd/2") `} dirt />

the snare only sounds every other cycle

we can choose different sounds from a set using :

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio casio casio")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt />

the computer starts counting at 0, so casio:0 is the same as casio

we can add a rest using ~

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 ~ casio:5")`} dirt />

we can create more variation with sub-sequences
we do this by breaking our steps down into mini patterns using []

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd bd hh")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh oh/2]")`} dirt />

you can nest sequences within sequences for dense patterns

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("[[bd [bd bd bd bd]] bd sd] [bd cp]")`} dirt />

we can also schedule events across multiple cycles using &lt;&gt;

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")`} dirt />

we can add some easy randomness using ?
? means the following sound will play with 50% probability

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8?")`} dirt />

## chaining functions (and making it sound more interesting)

there's also a shorthand for selecting the sample or the note of a synth
note that we chain functions together with .

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt />

we use a function called n and some mininotation to create a pattern of numbers

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio casio casio").n("0 1 0 5")`} dirt />

this next part is a bit confusing, don't worry too much if it doesn't make sense right now

because strudel always takes the rhythm from the first pattern
we can't do this

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio").n("0 1 0 5")`} dirt />

because strudel thinks there's only one event in the pattern

but if we write the n pattern first then that gives us what we want

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

we can use note to do the same thing with pitch

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

or we can combine the two

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio").n("<0 1>")`} dirt />

and we can make use of the mininotation we learned above in the note or n pattern

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1*3 <0 [~ 7]> 5").sound("casio <space jazz>")`} dirt />

strudel does its best to map the two patterns together
based on when each event in the pattern starts


## Effects
ok, let's try some effects

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")`} dirt />

the vowel effect is a kind of filter
note that we chain functions together using .

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").vowel("a")`} dirt />

we can use mini-notation to create a pattern in the effect

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").vowel("<a e>")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").vowel("a e i")`} dirt />

most effects take a pattern of numbers

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").pan("0 1")`} dirt />

pan moves the signal left and right


room is reverb

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").room("<0 0 1 2>")`} dirt />

we can chain effects together

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").room("<0 0 1 2>").pan("0 1").vowel("<a o p>")`} dirt />
